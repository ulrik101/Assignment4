I worked Alone in this submission.

I was unable to complete the Assignment. I was able to create working Template Double Linked Lists and Queues.
I was also able to auto sort data(window idle and student wait times) in such a way to make collecting mean/median/longest time easy.

I have worked several days on this in big 8+ hour clumps. I have worked all the way up until the deadline and got stuck stuck on a critical
aspect that i dont understand.As Such I do not have the time to do things i would normally do.


I was unable to get data retrieval perfected in OfficeObject::updateTime() so I could increment the variables within the student and window objects.
This function/method is where all of the idle and wait times were calculated. I got the Window Idle time working just fine,
but was having a serious issue retrieving data from the Student Object through the Window Object. 


No makefile was available at this time of submission.
